## This directory shows detailed evolution plots (similar to Figure 1 of our MRR paper) for several binaries that form BBHs that undergo MRR in our fiducial model (A). 
In this particular directory we show detailed plots of 5 example binaries at low (Z=0.00101) and 5 example binaries at solar-like (Z=0.01416) metallicity and compare the fiducial model (where all these binaries form a MRR BBH) to the same binaries but where we changed in the simulation the mass transfer efficiency \beta to 0.25.   Each plot shows two binaries (low metallicity in top panel, solar-like metallicity in bottom panel). Each panel shows the evolution from the fiducial and the varied model with different colors for the primary and secondary star. We show both the masses evolution as well as the radii and Roche Lobe radii evolution.
