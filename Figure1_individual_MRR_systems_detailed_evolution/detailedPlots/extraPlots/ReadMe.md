# This directory provides extra details and examples on the impact of different stellar evolution parameter variations on the evolution of a massive binary leading to a Binary Black Hole Merger that undergoes Mass Ratio Reversal (MRR)

## The parameter variations explored here are the mass transfer efficiency parameter (beta), the Wolf Rayet wind multiplier = 5 model,  



## Contents of this directory

 - [fiducial_vs_all_betas](https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/MRR_Project/tree/main/Figure1_individual_MRR_systems_detailed_evolution/detailedPlots/extraPlots/fiducial_vs_all_betas) 
 compares the evolution of 10 massive binaries for changing the beta parameters between the fiducial model (A), beta=0.25 (B), beta=0.5 (C), and beta=0.75 (D). The folder contains plots of the masses as a function of time for 10 binaries. Each pdf figure contains two panels, with one binary evolution at low metallicity (top panel) and one at solar metallicity (bottom panel). So there are 2 binaries per figure. 
Each panel shows the evolution of the masses for the 4 different mass transfer efficiency prescriptions. The different prescriptions are plotted with different colors. 

 - [fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_25](https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/MRR_Project/tree/main/Figure1_individual_MRR_systems_detailed_evolution/detailedPlots/extraPlots/fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_25)
this directory is similar to the 'fiducial_vs_all_betas' directory, but instead only shows a comparison between fiducial versus the beta=0.25 mass transfer efficiency models. This is done for clarity (fewer lines). In addition to the mass evolution plots, this directory also contains for each system a figure that shows the Radii evolution as well as the Roche Lobe Radii evolution for both stars. The latter figures can be recognized by having the words 'Radius1Radius2' in the name of the file, whilst the mass plots have the same label but contain the name 'mass1mass2'

 - [fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_5](https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/MRR_Project/tree/main/Figure1_individual_MRR_systems_detailed_evolution/detailedPlots/extraPlots/fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_5)
this directory is similar to the 'fiducial_vs_all_betas' directory, but instead only shows a comparison between fiducial versus the beta=0.5 mass transfer efficiency models. This is done for clarity (fewer lines). In addition to the mass evolution plots, this directory also contains for each system a figure that shows the Radii evolution as well as the Roche Lobe Radii evolution for both stars. The latter figures can be recognized by having the words 'Radius1Radius2' in the name of the file, whilst the mass plots have the same label but contain the name 'mass1mass2'

 - [fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_75](https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/MRR_Project/tree/main/Figure1_individual_MRR_systems_detailed_evolution/detailedPlots/extraPlots/fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_75)
this directory is similar to the 'fiducial_vs_all_betas' directory, but instead only shows a comparison between fiducial versus the beta=0.75 mass transfer efficiency models. This is done for clarity (fewer lines). In addition to the mass evolution plots, this directory also contains for each system a figure that shows the Radii evolution as well as the Roche Lobe Radii evolution for both stars.

this directory is similar to the directory 'fiducial_vs_massTransferEfficiencyFixed_0_75' but now shows a comparison between fiducial versus the f_WR = 5  models (T).  The folder contains the mass evolution plots and also contains for each system a figure that shows the Radii evolution as well as the Roche Lobe Radii evolution for both stars. The latter figures can be recognized by having the words 'Radius1Radius2' in the name of the file, whilst the mass plots have the same label but contain the name 'mass1mass2'
