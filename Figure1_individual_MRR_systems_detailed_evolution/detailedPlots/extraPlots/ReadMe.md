# This directory provides extra details and examples on the impact of the mass transfer efficiency parameter (beta) on the evolution of a massive binary leading to a Binary Black Hole Merger that undergoes Mass Ratio Reversal (MRR)

 - [fiducial_vs_all_betas](https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/MRR_Project/tree/main/Figure1_individual_MRR_systems_detailed_evolution/detailedPlots/extraPlots/fiducial_vs_all_betas) 
 compares the evolution of 10 massive binaries for changing the beta parameters between the fiducial model (A), beta=0.25 (B), beta=0.5 (C), and beta=0.75 (D). The folder contains plots of the masses as a function of time for 10 binaries. Each pdf figure contains two panels, with one binary evolution at low metallicity (top panel) and one at solar metallicity (bottom panel). So there are 2 binaries per figure. 
Each panel shows the evolution of the masses for the 4 different mass transfer efficiency prescriptions. The different prescriptions are plotted with different colors.
